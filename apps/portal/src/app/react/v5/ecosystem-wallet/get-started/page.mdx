# Connect Users to your Ecosystem

## Using the Connect UI components

If you're building a [React website](/typescript/react/v5/ConnectButton), [React Native app](/react-native/v5/), or [Unity game](/unity/ConnectWallet) you can use the prebuilt connect UI components to authenticate users and connect their wallets accross your ecosystem.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId });
const wallets = [ecosystemWallet("ecosystem.your-ecosystem-id")];

export default function App() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider>
			<ConnectButton client={client} wallets={wallets} />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```

## Using your own UI

You can also build your own UI using the low-level hooks and functions. Remember to wrap your app in a `ThirdwebProvider` to ensure that the wallet is available to all components in your app.

```tsx
import { ecosystemWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const wallet = ecosystemWallet("ecosystem.your-ecosystem-id");

const LoginComponent = () => {
	const { connect, isLoading } = useConnect();

	return <button onClick={() => connect(async () => {
		await wallet.connect({
			client,
			strategy: "discord", // or any supported auth strategy
		})
		return wallet;
	})}>Connect</button>;
};
```

## Configuring auth strategies

You can configure the allowed auth strategies on [your dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team/~/~/ecosystem).

<DocImage src={EcosystemSocialConfig}/>

For prebuilt UIs, the enabled auth strategies are automatically read from your dashbaord configurations.

For custom UIs, you can configure the auth options when connecting the wallet. See [using your own UI](#using-your-own-ui) for an example. 

<Callout variant="warning" title="Using disabled auth strategies">
	Note that while you're allowed to pass any auth strategy today, we recommend only passing the strategies that are enabled on your dashboard. We might enforce this in the future.
</Callout>



## Passing a partner ID

For closed ecosystems, you can pass a valid `partnerId` to the `ecosystemWallet` provided by the ecosystem owner.

```tsx
const wallet = ecosystemWallet("ecosystem.your-ecosystem-id", {
	partnerId: "your-partner-id",
});
```
